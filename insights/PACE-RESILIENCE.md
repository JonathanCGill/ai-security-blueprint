# PACE Resilience

> *The canonical PACE Resilience document lives at the root of the framework. See **[PACE Resilience Methodology](../PACE-RESILIENCE.md)** for the full structured approach to ensuring no single failure in your AI security controls is catastrophic.*

For PACE applied to specific control layers, see:
- [Control Layer Resilience](../core/pace-controls-section.md) — PACE for Guardrails, Judge, and Human Oversight
- [PACE for Agentic AI](../core/pace-agentic-section.md) — PACE for agentic deployments
- [PACE Checklist](../core/pace-checklist-section.md) — implementation verification
