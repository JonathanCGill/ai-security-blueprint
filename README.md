## The Problem

Traditional software assurance relies on design-time testing. You write code, test it, prove it works, ship it.

**AI breaks this model.**

- **Non-deterministic** — Same input can produce different outputs
- **Emergent behavior** — You can't predict all failure modes
- **Adversarial inputs** — Users will find edge cases your test suite never imagined

You can't fully test an AI system before deployment. So how do you know it's working correctly?

## Before You Proceed

> **[The First Control: Choosing the Right Tool](insights/the-first-control.md)**
>
> The most effective way to reduce AI risk is to not use AI where it doesn't belong. Before guardrails, judges, or human oversight — ask whether AI is the right tool for this problem. Design thinking should precede technology selection.

Everything in this Framework assumes you've already answered "yes" to that fundamental question.

---

## The Pattern

The industry is converging on an answer: **runtime behavioral monitoring**.

Instead of proving correctness at design time, you continuously verify behavior in production.

| Layer | Function | Timing |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Guardrails** | Prevent known-bad inputs/outputs | Real-time (~10ms) |
| **Judge** | Detect unknown-bad via LLM evaluation | Async (~500ms–5s) |
| **Human Oversight** | Decide edge cases, remain accountable | As needed |

**Guardrails prevent. Judge detects. Humans decide.**

> Design reviews prove intent. Behavioral monitoring proves reality.

## This Isn't New

This pattern already exists in production. What's been missing is a clear explanation of *why* it's necessary and *how* to implement it proportionate to risk.

### Platforms Implementing This Pattern

| Platform | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| [NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) | 5 rail types: input, dialog, retrieval, execution, output |
| [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/) | Middleware + human-in-the-loop |
| [Guardrails AI](https://www.guardrailsai.com/) | Open-source validator framework |
| [Galileo](https://www.rungalileo.io/) | Eval-to-guardrail lifecycle |
| [Confident AI / DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) | LLM-as-judge evaluation framework |
| AWS Bedrock Guardrails | Managed input/output filtering |
| Azure AI Content Safety | Content filtering and moderation |

### Standards Describing the Risks

| Standard | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| [OWASP LLM Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) | Security vulnerabilities in LLM applications |
| [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications](https://genai.owasp.org/) | Risks specific to autonomous AI agents |
| [NIST AI RMF](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) | Risk management framework |
| [ISO 42001](https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html) | AI management system standard |

**Out of scope:**

- Vendor AI products (Copilot, Gemini, etc.) — use vendor controls
- Model training — see MLOps security guidance
- Pre-deployment testing — this guide is about production monitoring

This guide is **operationally focused** — deployment through incident response.
