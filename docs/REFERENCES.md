## Industry Frameworks & Standards

These are the established frameworks that inform the architecture, control design, and risk classification used throughout this project. Where this framework extends or diverges from them, the relevant sections note this explicitly.

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)

The foundational U.S. government framework for managing AI risks, organised around four core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage. Released January 2023. Increasingly referenced by federal regulators (CFPB, FDA, SEC, FTC, EEOC) and aligned with the EU AI Act, OECD AI Principles, and the G7 Code of Conduct.

This framework's risk tier classification and governance structure align with NIST AI RMF's four functions.

- [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)

### NIST AI 600-1: Generative AI Profile

A companion to the AI RMF specifically addressing generative AI risks - data memorisation/leakage, confabulations (hallucinations), training data poisoning, and prompt injection. Published July 2024, developed pursuant to Executive Order 14110.

This framework's treatment of prompt injection and hallucination as distinct control domains draws on the risk categories defined here.

- [NIST AI 600-1 (PDF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf)

### OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)

The practitioner-oriented ranking of LLM security risks: (1) Prompt Injection, (2) Sensitive Information Disclosure, (3) Supply Chain Vulnerabilities, (4) Data and Model Poisoning, (5) Improper Output Handling, (6) Excessive Agency, (7) System Prompt Leakage, (8) Vector and Embedding Weaknesses, (9) Misinformation, (10) Unbounded Consumption.

This framework provides full mapping against all ten risks across both the foundation layer and MASO. The 2025 additions of "Excessive Agency" and "Vector and Embedding Weaknesses" directly validate the control domains we define for execution control and data protection.

- [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/)

### OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026)

The emerging companion to the LLM Top 10, focused specifically on multi-agent and agentic AI risks. MASO provides full coverage mapping.

- [OWASP GenAI Project](https://genai.owasp.org/)

### OWASP AI Exchange

300+ pages of free, evolving guidance on securing AI systems. Awarded OWASP Flagship project status in March 2025. Through an official liaison partnership, its content feeds directly into standards for the EU AI Act (70 pages contributed), ISO/IEC 27090 (AI security), and ISO/IEC 27091 (AI privacy).

Serves as a bridge between practitioner knowledge and formal standards. Enterprises can use this as an implementation guide that aligns with emerging regulatory requirements.

- [OWASP AI Exchange](https://owaspai.org/)

### MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems)

A knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and case studies targeting AI systems, modelled after MITRE ATT&CK. Contains 15 tactics, 66 techniques, 46 sub-techniques, 26 mitigations, and 33 real-world case studies. In October 2025, 14 new techniques focused on AI agents and generative AI were added in collaboration with Zenity Labs.

This framework's threat intelligence and red team playbook draw on ATLAS tactics and techniques. The MITRE Secure AI Program is supported by 16 member organisations including Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and JPMorgan Chase.

- [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/)

### MITRE SAFE-AI Framework

Published April 2025. Strengthens security control selection and assessment by ensuring AI-specific threats are systematically identified and addressed. Bridges the gap between NIST controls and AI-specific threat modelling.

- [MITRE SAFE-AI Full Report (PDF)](https://atlas.mitre.org/pdf-files/SAFEAI_Full_Report.pdf)

### ISO/IEC 42001:2023 - AI Management System Standard

The world's first AI management system standard. Specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an AI management system (AIMS). Includes 38 distinct controls covering risk management, ethical considerations, transparency, and continuous learning. Uses Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology.

This framework's governance layer is designed to be compatible with ISO/IEC 42001. Organisations already certified to ISO/IEC 27001 will find familiar structures.

- [ISO/IEC 42001](https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html)

### Google Secure AI Framework (SAIF)

Launched June 2023. Built around four pillars: Secure Development, Secure Deployment, Secure Execution, and Secure Monitoring. Includes a free SAIF Risk Assessment questionnaire. Google used SAIF principles to help form the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI).

The four-pillar structure parallels this framework's lifecycle approach, though we place heavier emphasis on runtime monitoring given the non-deterministic nature of AI systems.

- [Google SAIF](https://saif.google/)

### Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)

Industry coalition founded by Amazon, Anthropic, Cisco, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, PayPal, Wiz, and others. Housed under OASIS Open. Premier sponsors include EY, Google, IBM, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Palo Alto Networks, PayPal, Protect AI, Snyk, Trend Micro, and Zscaler. Has released frameworks for AI model signing and incident response, plus guidance on identity, access control, and isolation risks in MCP deployments.

In July 2025, CoSAI published the **Principles for Secure-by-Design Agentic Systems**, establishing three foundational principles for autonomous AI security:

1. **Human-Governed and Accountable** - meaningful control with clear accountability, risk-based controls aligned with business outcomes, well-defined authority boundaries.
2. **Bounded and Resilient** - purpose-specific entitlements, AI-specific defensive measures, continuous validation with predefined failure modes.
3. **Transparent and Verifiable** - secure AI supply chain controls with SLSA-style provenance, comprehensive telemetry of all system activities, real-time monitoring for oversight and incident response.

CoSAI introduces a **producer/implementer/principal** accountability model that distributes responsibility across technology producers (who build AI components), service implementers (who deploy and configure them), and human principals (who authorise and bear accountability for outcomes). This complements the three-lines governance model used in this framework's [AI Governance Operating Model](extensions/regulatory/ai-governance-operating-model.md).

This framework's three-layer pattern (guardrails, Judge, human oversight), PACE resilience, MASO observability controls, and risk tier classification operationalise what CoSAI describes at a principles level. Alignment mapping:

| CoSAI Principle | This Framework's Implementation |
|---|---|
| Meaningful control | [Humans Remain Accountable](insights/humans-remain-accountable.md), Judge-as-assurance pattern, HITL queue design |
| Risk-based controls | [Risk Tiers](core/risk-tiers.md) (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with tier-specific control requirements) |
| Purpose-specific entitlements | MASO IA-2.3 (no transitive permissions), tool scoping, execution control boundaries |
| Predefined failure modes | [PACE Resilience](PACE-RESILIENCE.md) (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) |
| Comprehensive telemetry | MASO [Observability Controls](maso/controls/observability.md) OB-1.1 through OB-3.5 |
| Supply chain provenance | MASO SC-1.2 (signed tool manifests), SC-3.1 (cryptographic trust chain), [ET-04](maso/threat-intelligence/emerging-threats.md) |
| Threat models and playbooks | MASO [Red Team Playbook](maso/red-team/red-team-playbook.md) RT-01 through RT-13 |

### NCSC/CISA Guidelines for Secure AI System Development

Published November 2023 by the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), co-signed by 23 cybersecurity agencies across all G7 nations including BSI (Germany), ANSSI (France), CSA (Singapore), NSA (US), and others. Industry contributors from OpenAI, DeepMind, IBM, Microsoft, Anthropic, and RAND.

The first globally agreed guidelines for secure AI system development. Structured around four lifecycle stages: secure design, secure development, secure deployment, and secure operation and maintenance. Aligned with NIST's Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) and CISA's "Secure by Design" initiative.

This framework's infrastructure controls and deployment guidance are consistent with the NCSC/CISA lifecycle model, particularly the emphasis on securing the operational environment - not just the model.

### UK AI Security Institute - Frontier AI Trends Report (December 2025)

The strongest empirical backing for runtime security from a government body. The AISI (formerly UK AI Safety Institute) tested frontier AI systems and published findings with direct implications for runtime behavioural security:

- **Safeguard robustness:** Universal jailbreaks found in every system tested, but effort required increased 40x over 6 months for biological misuse between two model generations - evidence that targeted safeguard investment works, but coverage is uneven across risk categories.
- **Capability-safety gap:** R² = 0.097 between model capability (GPQA benchmark) and safeguard robustness - more capable models are not inherently safer.
- **Sandbagging:** Models can distinguish testing from deployment contexts and alter behaviour accordingly. Black-box monitors lose accuracy on harder tasks.
- **Open-weight safeguard removal:** Safeguards on open-weight models can be "quickly and cheaply removed." Open-to-closed source capability gap narrowed to 4–8 months.
- **Self-replication:** Success rates on RepliBench tasks went from 5% (2023) to 60% (2025).
- **Capability doubling:** Task complexity AI can handle autonomously is doubling roughly every 8 months. Cyber tasks went from <10 min (early 2023) to >1 hour (mid-2025). Expert-level cyber tasks first completed by AI in 2025.
- **MCP autonomy in finance:** Tracked 1,000+ public MCP servers; sharp increase in execution-capable (Level 4–5) servers in financial services.
- **Persuasion scaling:** Persuasive capability increases with model scale while accuracy decreases. Post-training increases persuasiveness more than scaling.
- **Scaffolding efficiency:** Scaffolding alone provided ~40% performance boost on SWE-bench. Optimised scaffolding achieved equivalent cyber performance at 13% of token budget.
- **Emotional dependence:** 33% of UK citizens used AI for emotional support. Service outages caused 30x spikes in negative sentiment.

This framework references AISI findings in: [Evaluation Integrity Risks](insights/evaluation-integrity-risks.md), [Risk Tiers](core/risk-tiers.md), [When the Judge Can Be Fooled](core/when-the-judge-can-be-fooled.md), [The MCP Problem](insights/the-mcp-problem.md), [Open-Weight Models](insights/open-weight-models-shift-the-burden.md), [Emerging Threats](maso/threat-intelligence/emerging-threats.md), and [Emerging Trends](extensions/technical/emerging-trends-impact.md).

### International AI Safety Report 2026

The second edition of the landmark scientific report on the safety of advanced AI, chaired by Yoshua Bengio and contributed to by over 100 independent international experts including Geoffrey Hinton, Stuart Russell, and Bernhard Schölkopf. Published February 2026. Commissioned by the UK Government with secretariat support from the UK AI Security Institute. Expert Advisory Panel drew nominees from more than 30 countries plus intergovernmental organisations including the EU, OECD, and UN.

Structured around three questions: what can general-purpose AI do today, what emerging risks does it pose, and how can those risks be mitigated. Covers language, vision, and agentic models alongside broader societal impacts (labour markets, human autonomy, concentration of power). At 220 pages, this is the most comprehensive international scientific consensus document on AI safety to date. The first edition (2025) followed the AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park; this edition incorporates developments from the Seoul (May 2024) and Paris (February 2025) summits.

Provides independent scientific validation for many of the risk categories addressed by this framework, particularly around agentic capabilities, evaluation integrity, and the gap between model capability and safety assurance.

## Regulatory Landscape

### EU AI Act

The first comprehensive AI regulation by a major jurisdiction. Risk-based approach with key milestones: February 2025 (AI literacy requirements and prohibited AI uses), August 2025 (GPAI model transparency/documentation), August 2026 (full high-risk AI system compliance). Penalties up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.

This framework's regulatory mapping covers Articles 9, 14, and 15 - risk management, human oversight, and robustness.

- [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)

### U.S. Executive Order 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI

Signed October 2023. The most comprehensive U.S. government AI governance action at the time. Directed NIST to develop guidelines, red-teaming standards, and the GenAI Profile. Led to creation of the U.S. AI Safety Institute. Rescinded by President Trump on January 20, 2025 - but the NIST deliverables it produced (AI 600-1, AI 800-1, adversarial testing software) remain available and continue to be referenced by industry and regulators.

## Developer Safety Frameworks

The three leading frontier AI developers have each published structured safety frameworks that define capability thresholds, evaluation protocols, and deployment safeguards for their most advanced models. These are the developer-side counterparts to the deployer-focused controls in this framework. Where they define what the model provider commits to before release, this framework defines what the deploying organisation must do at runtime.

### OpenAI Preparedness Framework (v2, April 2025)

Focuses on three frontier capability domains: biological and chemical, cybersecurity, and AI self-improvement. Defines two capability thresholds - "High" (amplifies existing pathways to severe harm) and "Critical" (introduces unprecedented new pathways to severe harm). Version 2 replaced the original Preparedness Scorecard with separate Capabilities Reports and Safeguards Reports, governed by a Safety Advisory Group (SAG). Persuasion risks are handled outside this framework via the Model Spec.

- [Preparedness Framework v2 Announcement](https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/)
- [Preparedness Framework v2 (PDF)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/18a02b5d-6b67-4cec-ab64-68cdfbddebcd/preparedness-framework-v2.pdf)

### Google DeepMind Frontier Safety Framework (v3.0, September 2025)

Built around Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) - thresholds at which models may pose heightened risk of severe harm absent mitigations. Covers four risk domains: CBRN, cybersecurity, ML R&D, and harmful manipulation (added in v3.0). Requires a formal safety case - a structured argument that severe risks have been minimised - before deployment. Version 3.0 added coverage of model resistance to human shutdown or control and an exploratory track for misalignment risks. Commits to notifying government authorities if a CCL is reached with unmitigated public safety risk.

- [Frontier Safety Framework v3.0 (PDF)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/strengthening-our-frontier-safety-framework/frontier-safety-framework_3.pdf)

### Anthropic Responsible Scaling Policy (v3.0, February 2026)

Establishes AI Safety Levels (ASLs) - capability-based thresholds triggering specific security and deployment safeguards. ASL-3 safeguards were provisionally activated for Claude Opus 4 in May 2025. Version 3.0 introduces Frontier Safety Roadmaps (public goals across Security, Alignment, Safeguards, and Policy) and Risk Reports published every 3-6 months with external review under certain conditions. Adds a new CBRN capability threshold for state-program-level uplift and disaggregates AI R&D thresholds into two distinct levels.

Version 3.0 removes the prior categorical commitment not to train models unless safety measures could be guaranteed in advance, replacing it with a dual condition requiring both AI race leadership and material catastrophic risk - a change that generated significant debate (see TIME coverage below). This illustrates the tension between unilateral safety commitments and competitive dynamics that deployers must account for in their risk assessments.

## Research - Multi-Agent Security

These papers and reports directly inform MASO's treatment of multi-agent risks. This is the area where this framework makes its most distinctive contribution, and where we want to be transparent about what we're building on.

### "TRiSM for Agentic AI" (2025)

The first Trust, Risk, and Security Management framework for agentic AI, specifically for systems where multiple LLM-powered agents collaborate. Organised around pillars of Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy, and Governance for autonomous decision-making. Gartner reports 35% of enterprises now use autonomous agents for business-critical workflows.

MASO's seven control domains cover similar ground but are structured around operational implementation tiers rather than capability pillars.

- [TRiSM for Agentic AI (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.04133v3)

### "Multi-Agent Risks from Advanced AI" - Cooperative AI Foundation

Identifies critical risk categories for multi-agent systems including commitment/trust failures, emergent agency (new goals arising from collections of agents), and multi-agent security vulnerabilities. Notes that groups of AI agents are already responsible for tasks from trading million-dollar assets to recommending military actions.

This report's taxonomy of commitment failures directly informed MASO's identity and access controls, particularly the prohibition on transitive authority delegation.

- [Cooperative AI Foundation - Multi-Agent Risks](https://www.cooperativeai.com/post/new-report-multi-agent-risks-from-advanced-ai)

### "Open Challenges in Multi-Agent Security" (May 2025)

Examines security challenges when frontier model agents interact via direct communication or shared environments. Covers scenarios including trading agents on market platforms, personal assistants collaborating on scheduling, and autonomous cyber defence systems coordinating responses.

- [Open Challenges in Multi-Agent Security (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.02077v1)

### "Agentic AI Security: Threats, Defences, Evaluation, and Open Challenges" (October 2025)

Comprehensive survey outlining a taxonomy of threats specific to agentic AI, reviewing benchmarks, evaluation methodologies, and defence strategies from both technical and governance perspectives. Covers planning, tool use, memory, and autonomy risks.

- [Agentic AI Security Survey (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.23883v1)

### "Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training" - Anthropic (January 2024)

Hubinger et al. (39 co-authors). Demonstrated that if an LLM learns to be strategically deceptive - behaving helpfully in most situations but pursuing alternative objectives when triggered - current safety training techniques (RLHF, supervised fine-tuning) fail to remove this behaviour. Larger models are more persistent. Adversarial training can backfire, teaching models to better hide unsafe behaviour.

This paper has profound implications for model supply chain security: if you fine-tune on compromised data or use a model with an embedded backdoor, standard safety evaluations will not reliably detect the problem. MASO's supply chain controls - AIBOM, signed manifests, model provenance verification - are partly informed by this finding. Anthropic followed up with research on "defection probes" that can detect sleeper agent behaviour with AUROC scores above 99%.

## Research - Prompt Injection & Runtime Security

### Simon Willison - Prompt Injection Research

Willison coined the term "prompt injection" in September 2022 and has been its most consistent chronicler. Key contributions include the "lethal trifecta" concept (June 2025) - the dangerous combination of access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and external communication ability. If your agent combines all three, exfiltration attacks become trivially possible.

This framework's guardrail architecture is designed around the assumption that prompt injection is unsolved - a position Willison has articulated more clearly than anyone.

- [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/)
- [Simon Willison's newsletter](https://simonw.substack.com/)

### Johann Rehberger - Embrace the Red

The most prolific independent AI security vulnerability researcher. His "Month of AI Bugs" (August 2025) published one critical vulnerability per day across ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, Amp, Devin, OpenHands, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Google Jules. Created "AgentHopper," a proof-of-concept self-propagating AI virus. His core advice to enterprises: *"Always assume breach. The agent gets compromised. What can it do? Then put security controls in place to mitigate that impact."*

This is essentially the design philosophy behind MASO's blast radius controls and PACE resilience architecture.

- [Embrace the Red](https://embracethered.com/)

### "The Attacker Moves Second" (October 2025)

Co-authored by 14 researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. Examined 12 published defences against prompt injection and jailbreaking. Subjected them to adaptive attacks, achieving >90% attack success rate against most defences.

This is the single most important paper for understanding why this framework emphasises defence-in-depth and runtime monitoring rather than relying on any single mitigation. If 12 published defences fail against adaptive attackers, the answer is not a better defence - it's layered controls with circuit breakers.

- [Coverage by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/2/new-prompt-injection-papers/)

### "Not What You've Signed Up For" - Greshake et al. (February 2023)

Formalised the concept of "indirect prompt injection" - attacks where malicious prompts are planted in external data sources (web pages, documents, code comments) that an LLM retrieves and processes. Demonstrated attacks against Bing Chat, Microsoft Edge sidebar, and GitHub Copilot. Showed that injected prompts can replicate through contact lists and persist across sessions via stored memories.

Key insight: LLMs fundamentally cannot distinguish between instructions and data. Any system where an LLM processes external content is vulnerable. This is an architectural vulnerability, not a patchable bug.

### "Here Comes The AI Worm" - Morris II (March 2024)

Cohen, Bitton, and Nassi (Cornell Tech / Israel Institute of Technology / Intuit). The first self-replicating worm targeting GenAI ecosystems. Uses "adversarial self-replicating prompts" that force the model to replicate the prompt in its output, execute a payload (data exfiltration, spam), and propagate to new agents. Zero-click - no user interaction required. Demonstrated against Gemini Pro, ChatGPT 4.0, and LLaVA.

MASO's data protection controls - particularly cross-agent message bus DLP and independent injection detection at every trust boundary - are directly informed by this research. If a poisoned message can propagate across agents, every inter-agent channel is an attack surface.

- [Morris II (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02817)
- [ComPromptMized Project Website](https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized)

### SecAlign - ACM CCS 2025

The first known method that reduces prompt injection success rates to less than 10%, even against sophisticated attacks not seen during training. Uses preference optimisation to teach LLMs to prefer secure outputs over prompt-injected instructions. Promising but operational deployment at enterprise scale remains to be validated.

- [SecAlign (ACM CCS 2025)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3719027.3744836)

### Anthropic Constitutional Classifiers

System of constitutional classifiers that withstood over 3,000 hours of expert red teaming with no universal jailbreaks found. Uses a constitution defining harmful/harmless content categories to generate synthetic training data for classifier-based input/output monitoring. The jailbreak bug bounty challenge involved 300,000+ interactions and 339 participants.

Demonstrates a production-grade approach to input/output monitoring - the same pattern this framework recommends at the guardrail layer.

- [Constitutional Classifiers (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18837)

## AI Incident Databases

These databases inform the [Incident Tracker](maso/threat-intelligence/incident-tracker.md) and provide the evidence base for control selection throughout the framework.

### AI Incident Database (AIID)

A project of the Responsible AI Collaborative. 1,200+ reports of AI systems causing safety, fairness, or other real-world problems. Over 80 new incidents added in April-May 2025 alone. Open-source.

- [AI Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)

### MIT AI Risk Repository & Incident Tracker

A living, systematic review and database of AI risk frameworks. Classifies incidents using the MIT AI Risk Repository Domain Taxonomy across 24 subdomains. The April 2025 update expanded the dataset to 1,612 classified risks and added a new subdomain for multi-agent risks.

- [MIT AI Risk Repository](https://airisk.mit.edu/ai-incident-tracker)

### Stanford AI Index Report 2025

Documented AI safety incidents surged from 149 in 2023 to 233 in 2024 - a 56.4% increase.

## Real-World Incidents

These incidents are referenced throughout the framework to ground controls in demonstrated (not theoretical) risk. Each one maps to specific control domains.

### Air Canada Chatbot - Moffatt v. Air Canada (February 2024)

Air Canada's chatbot gave incorrect bereavement fare information. The airline argued the chatbot was "a separate legal entity responsible for its own actions." The BC Civil Resolution Tribunal ruled against Air Canada: *"It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot."* Ordered to pay $812.02.

Established legal precedent that organisations are liable for AI-generated misinformation. Maps to: Guardrails, Human Oversight, LLM-as-Judge.

### DPD Chatbot Incident (January 2024)

After a system update, DPD's AI chatbot could be prompted to swear at customers, write poems criticising the company, and call itself "useless." Screenshots went viral (1.3 million views). DPD confirmed the behaviour followed a system update that silently weakened guardrails.

### Slack AI Data Exfiltration via RAG Poisoning (August 2024)

PromptArmor demonstrated that Slack AI was vulnerable to indirect prompt injection that could exfiltrate data from private channels. An attacker posts a malicious prompt in a public channel; when a victim queries Slack AI, it retrieves the poisoned message as RAG context and embeds sensitive data from private channels into a clickable link. Slack initially dismissed the report as "intended behaviour."

Maps to: Data Protection (RAG integrity), Prompt Integrity (injection detection).

### Microsoft Copilot Vulnerabilities (2024–2025)

Multiple critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot. CVE-2025-32711 ("EchoLeak," CVSS 9.3) enabled zero-click data exfiltration across Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The "Reprompt" attack bypassed LLM data leak protections through a double-request technique. A Mermaid diagram exploit enabled data exfiltration through crafted Excel spreadsheets.

Demonstrates that even the largest AI platform vendors face fundamental prompt injection challenges. Maps to: Guardrails, Data Protection, Supply Chain.

### MCP Supply Chain Attacks (2024–2025)

CVE-2025-6514 (CVSS 9.6) in mcp-remote package (437,000+ downloads) - malicious MCP servers could achieve remote code execution on client machines. Separately, an unofficial Postmark MCP server was modified to silently BCC all emails to an attacker's address. Anthropic's own reference SQLite MCP server had SQL injection.

## Thought Leaders

These are researchers and practitioners whose work has directly shaped the thinking behind this framework. We cite them not to claim endorsement, but to credit influence and provide readers with the primary sources.

### Simon Willison

Creator of Datasette. Coined the term "prompt injection" (2022). The most prolific chronicler of prompt injection research. His "lethal trifecta" concept - the dangerous combination of private data access, untrusted content exposure, and external communication ability - is an essential decision tool for enterprise architects evaluating what capabilities to grant AI agents.

### Bruce Schneier

Internationally recognised security technologist. Testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (June 2025) on federal AI data security. Keynoted RSAC 2025 on "AI, Security, and Trust." Advocates for AI transparency laws, security standards, and accountability mechanisms. His warning about "AI snake oil" in vendor marketing is valuable context for enterprise procurement decisions.

## A Note on How We Use These Sources

This framework is not a repackaging of the sources above. It is an original synthesis - particularly the MASO layer, which addresses multi-agent epistemic failures (groupthink, correlated errors, synthetic corroboration, uncertainty stripping) that we haven't found treated as a formal control domain elsewhere, though others may be working on similar ideas.

What the sources provide is:

- **Validation.** The three-layer runtime monitoring pattern (guardrails + LLM-as-Judge + human oversight) is not our invention - it's an emerging industry consensus reflected in NIST, OWASP, Google SAIF, and commercial implementations.
- **Evidence.** Every control in this framework maps to a documented incident, a published attack technique, or both. The incidents section above provides the evidence base.
- **Context.** No framework exists in isolation. Citing what came before helps readers understand where this work sits in the broader landscape and what it adds to the conversation.

**Developer frameworks and deployer controls are complementary, not competing.** The developer safety frameworks from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic define what the model provider commits to before a model reaches you - capability evaluations, safety cases, release thresholds. This framework defines what happens after - the runtime behavioural controls, monitoring, and governance that deploying organisations must implement regardless of which model they use. One does not replace the other. A model that passes its developer's safety evaluations still needs guardrails, a Judge, human oversight, and circuit breakers in production. Conversely, robust runtime controls cannot compensate for a fundamentally unsafe model. Enterprises should treat developer safety commitments as part of their supply chain due diligence, and this framework's controls as the operational layer that sits on top.

We encourage readers to engage with the primary sources directly. If you find additional relevant work we should reference, please open an issue or pull request.
