## Position Papers

### Why Containment Beats Evaluation

A position paper arguing that runtime containment — constraining what AI systems can do — is more reliable than evaluation-based approaches that try to determine what AI systems will do.

Covers the limitations of pre-deployment evaluation, the case for runtime enforcement, and how containment-first thinking changes control architecture.
