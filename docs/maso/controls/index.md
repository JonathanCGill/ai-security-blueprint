# Control Domains

Eleven domains cover what agents do to data, to tools, to each other, and to the truth. Each domain scales by tier: the more autonomy an agent has, the more of the domain applies. Everything here inherits from [Objective Intent](objective-intent.md), so read that first.

-   **Prompt, Goal & Epistemic Integrity**

    ---

    Keeping instructions, goals, and "facts" trustworthy as they pass between agents.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](prompt-goal-and-epistemic-integrity.md)

-   **Identity & Access**

    ---

    Per-agent identity and least-privilege permissions so authority cannot leak through hand-offs.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](identity-and-access.md)

-   **Data Protection**

    ---

    What data each agent may read, write, or move, and how it is protected in transit between them.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](data-protection.md)

-   **Document Extraction Integrity**

    ---

    Treating extracted document content as data to be checked, never as instructions to be obeyed.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](extraction-integrity.md)

-   **Execution Control**

    ---

    Constraining what actions an agent can actually commit, and gating the irreversible ones.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](execution-control.md)

-   **Observability**

    ---

    Seeing what the fleet did: the flight recorder for multi-agent behaviour.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](observability.md)

-   **Supply Chain**

    ---

    Trust in the models, tools, and packages the agents depend on.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](supply-chain.md)

-   **Privileged Agent Governance**

    ---

    Extra scrutiny for the agents that hold the keys.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](privileged-agent-governance.md)

-   **Model Cognition Assurance**

    ---

    Assurance that the models still reason the way you validated them to.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](model-cognition-assurance.md)

-   **Agentic Task Mandate**

    ---

    The scope of work an agent is mandated to perform, and the boundary it must not cross.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](agentic-task-mandate.md)

-   **Emergent Risk Register**

    ---

    The living record of risks that only appear once agents interact at scale.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Open](risk-register.md)

*At single-agent scale these collapse into the [ASO Core Controls](../../core/reference.md): the same protections, one boundary.*
